FISSA Suite2p Example
=====================

In the notebook we provide an example workflow to combine the `FISSA <fissa_>`_ and `Suite2p <suite2p_>`_ methods.

This repository mainly functions to provide environment files to run this notebook on Binder.
For the most up-to-date code and extensive documentation on FISSA, see the `FISSA <fissa_>`_ repository.

You can `view <suitehtml_>`_ the notebook on GitHub, `download <suitedown_>`_ it to your local machine, or interact with it in your web browser on `Binder <suitebind_>`_.
Note that launching a Binder session can take 10 minutes.

This notebook can also be run on your own machine.
To do so, you will need to:

1.  Download `a copy of this repository <download_repo_>`_, unzip it, and cd into the ``fissa-suite2p-example`` directory.

2.  Create a new conda environment with ``conda env create --file .binder/environment.yml``.

3.  Activate the environment with ``conda activate suite2p-fissa``.

4.  Start up a Jupyter notebook server to run our notebooks ``jupyter notebook``.

If you're new to Jupyter notebooks, here is `an approachable tutorial`_.
