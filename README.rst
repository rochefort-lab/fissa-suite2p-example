FISSA Suite2p Example
=====================
In the notebook we provide an example workflow to combine the `FISSA <fissa_>`_ and `Suite2p <suite2p_>`_ methods.

This repository mainly functions to provide environment files to run this notebook on `Binder <Binder_>`_.
For the most up-to-date code see the original `FISSA <fissa_>`_ repository.

You can `view <suitehtml_>`_ the notebook or directly interact with it on `Binder <suitebind_>`_. The notebook can also be separately `downloaded <suitedown_>`_.

This notebook can also be run on your own machine.
To do so, you will need to:

0.  If you want to run the Suite2p notebook, you'll have to install everything
    into a conda environment, as per their `installation instructions <install_suite2p_>`_.
    Note that this notebook was tested with Suite2p version 0.10.0
    
1.  Install fissa with its plotting dependencies ``pip install fissa[plotting]``.

2.  Download `a copy of the repository <download_repo_>`_, unzip it and browse
    to the examples_ directory.

3.  Start up a Jupyter notebook server to run our notebooks ``jupyter notebook``.

If you're new to Jupyter notebooks, here is `an approachable tutorial`_.
